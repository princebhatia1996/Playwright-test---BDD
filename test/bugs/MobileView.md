## Bug - The website does not conform properly in mobile view

#### When we resize the screen to responsive mode it does not properly align

### Expected behavior

I expect the elements to align correctly and evenly, how they are on the left side.

### Current behavior

On the login and client list page the elements on the right side of the screen are overflowing

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Login into the app
2. Enter responsive mode
3. Observe the elements on the right side overflowing onto the page

### Environment

Happening when I run the App locally. I don't have access to Prod environment to verify if it happening there.

### Severity

low impact as the app is still useable and the difference is not noticeable when when you reach a large breakpoint

### Screenshots
